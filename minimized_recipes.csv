Rezika's Chicken & Vegetable Curry,"This is my family's all time favourite curry. Originally this was an Afghani chicken curry - I ended up reducing the amount of chicken & adding chickpeas, potatoes & peas to. If you want to add more veggies, please feel free to do so.

Traditional English Cheddar Cauliflower Cheese - Gratin,"When I was growing up, we NEVER called this dish a ""Gratin"" - it was always Cauliflower cheese and was invariably our main meal and NOT an accompaniment! My mother had to be very clever and thrifty in what she bought & cooked, and in the absence of meat on the table, she used cheese as the protein! This dish has become very ""fashionable"" again is served in many guises, Cauliflower Noisette, Cauliflower Gratin, Cheese and Cauliflower Bake...but to me, it will always be just Cauliflower Cheese, and it remains one of my favourite meals! I do serve it as an accompaniment now, but you have to be very careful what you serve it with, as it is very cheesy and rich. Alternatively, just have it as a main meal and serve some homemade bread and butter with it and maybe some salad or steamed spring greens! By the way, if you make a large batch, it freezes very well - either in small plastic containers or in zip lock bags; defrost and microwave to re-heat OR reheat over a Bain Marie.

Traditional Buttery French Croissants for Lazy Bistro Breakfasts,"I do not profess to make these all the time; living in France gives me access to wonderful croissants and other French breakfast pastries, However, these are even BETTER than MOST I can buy at the boulangerie, really! It is a time consuming process to make them, but the results are well worth the effort. The butter-enriched dough can be made the night before and stored in the fridge, and it can also be frozen. Once you have the hang of adding the butter to the dough and turning and rolling it to trap the air in between the layers, you are nearly there with the technique. This is my own recipe for croissants, and the quantity yields between 8 and 12 croissants, depending on how accurate you are with the measurements of the triangles before they are rolled. I usually start my dough off in my bread machine for the mixing, kneading and proving - it just gives me more time in the kitchen to get on with other things. I have also given the traditional method by hand, and the dough can also be mixed with a dough hook in a food mixer - choose whatever method is best for you! These croissants can also be frozen - before being baked; defrost overnight in the fridge before baking as normal. Eat these with freshly ground coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh butter and a selection of confitures, jams and conserves.",,"['Preheat oven temperature to 200C/400F/Gas 6.', 'BREAD MACHINE: Put the milk, water, egg, flour, salt, sugar, 1 oz butter and the yeast into your machine and select dough, normal. This will mix, knead and prove the dough and takes about an hour and a half depending on your machine.', 'BY HAND: Put the egg, flour, salt, sugar, 1 oz butter and the yeast  in a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, slowly mix in the warm milk and the warm water until the mixture forms into a pliable dough. Cover and put the dough in a warm place, until it has nearly doubled in size.', 'BUTTER DOUGH: Place the dough (both from the bread machine and by hand) on a floured surface and knead well until it feels elastic.Return the dough to the bowl, cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Return the chilled dough to your floured work surface and roll it into a rectangular shape, around 50cm X 20cm - 20"" X 8"".', 'Separate the remaining butter into 3 portions and then using one third of the butter, dot the butter over the upper two thirds of the rolled dough, keeping a 1cm/1/2"" border around the edges. Fold the dough into three , bringing up the bottom unbuttered part of the dough, and then folding the top buttered part of the dough over.', 'Give the dough a half turn so that the open edges are now top and bottom and seal the edges with your rolling pin. Then take your rolling pin and press the dough at intervals to seal the dough and create air pockets. Roll out into a rectangle again, the same size, and then continue as before, two more times until your butter is used up - please see photos as a guide. It is important to return the rolled dough to the fridge in between each rolling to ensure the butter does not melt and the dough does not become too sticky. After the last rolling when all the butter is used, return the dough to the refrigerator to chill for a further 30 minutes.', 'Remove from fridge and roll carefully into a big rectangle 50cm/30cm/24inx12in cut in half lengthways, divide each half into 4 to 6 triangles. Take one triangle at a time,and brush the triangle with the egg wash of milk and egg. Then from the widest edge of the triangle, roll up loosely and place in a crescent shape on a tray. Brush with the  egg wash over the top for the glaze.', 'TO FREEZE: At this point the croissants can be frozen; Open freeze them on a large tray, a baking tray is fine and then pack them into a rigid container or freezer bags when they are frozen.

I noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor.

Bierocks (German Hamburger- and Cabbage-filled rolls),"This is a staple food in the small Kansas (primarily German-American) town where I was born, and is now a favorite at my house here in Belgium.

General Tso's Chicken (10),"Wow! This is even better than the BEST I have had in my fave Chinese restaurant. To make the meal go quickly prep everything the day or night before and store in the fridge. To make this easy to understand I have changed the terms to cornstarch slurry and sauce. The first is used to coat the chicken for frying, the second to coat the fried chicken. HTH I use a grater with small holes for the garlic or you can just zip all the sauce ingredients up in a blender or food processor. Enjoy! NOTE: I really appreciate all the reviews this recipe has received. I know that when making this it seems strange and like it just is not going to work. Trust that it will work even though the method and the way that the cornstarch slurry acts before cooking are so different. I was the same way the first time I made this. It does result in crispy pieces of chicken that are so like you find in a restaurant. The heat here is pretty much a balanced amount because some like it hot and some do not. Taste and add more heat as desired. Thanks again for trying this recipe. I hope that you have the great results that I have had time and again. Here is info, pics and heat levels of different chilies. http://www.foodsubs.com/Chilefre.html",40.0,"['Place sauce ingredients in a quart jar with a lid and shake to mix. If you make this ahead of time just refrigerate until needed, shaking it again when you are ready to use it.

Add ALL the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Using a fork remove ONE chicken piece at a time and let the excess mixture drip off. YES even though the mixture has a weird consistency it will not stick like paste and the excess will drip off. Add chicken to the hot (350 degree) oil and fry until crispy. Only cook 7 or 8 chicken pieces at a time. You do not want to lower the temp of the oil by cooking too many at a time.

Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti,"My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1/2 of the sauce from this 
recipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  I read and appreciate every one of them!  Chef Note:  After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss.

Sometimes I add them to the leftovers (if there are any :-) so that is feels like something new the next day!  I have also made it several times with shredded pork which turns it into a pork carnitas type of soup.  If you like it on the spicy and smoke side buy a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and mince up one or two and add it.

Slow Simmered Spaghetti and Meatballs (Crock Pot),"This was one of those serendipitous happenings that continue to amaze/amuse me.  My DS called me on a Wednesday evening around suppertime to ask if it would be alright to come visit for the weekend, bringing his boys.  They would arrive Friday at suppertime.  Since I knew that DD and her family would want to be included for dinner to give her more time to visit w/ her brother over the weekend... I suddenly went from ""just me"" for dinner to ""eight"" for dinner!  What to fix at the last minute like this???  A while later I was reading the paper and came across this recipe in the food section and thought:  AH HA!  Dinner!  I bought the ingredients after work on Thursday and, Friday morning, everything went into the crock pot (I made a double batch).  When I got home after work, I made a salad, wrapped bakery Italian bread in foil to heat in the oven, and started the water boiling for the spaghetti.  Everyone LOVED it, as I did too, and the leftovers were scarfed up by the grand kids the next day for lunch.  Age ranges of diners were 18 months up to ... well, let's just say I'm a grandmother of five!  This will definitely be a repeater at my house!  (Recipe courtesy of B. Mills & A.

Staffordshire Oatcakes - Traditional English Hotcakes - Pancakes,"Delicious light pancakes made with oats and yeast - traditionally from the Midlands region in England, in particular the county of Staffordshire.

Once only eaten locally, the Staffordshire Oatcake has grown steadily in popularity over recent years. The traditional filling would be practically any combination of ingredients from an âall-day breakfastâ but anything goes these days. Chicken curry, chilli con carne, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and coronation chicken are now quite the norm amongst the oatcake avant-garde, as well as golden syrup, honey, jam and cream.",66.0,"['Pour the milk and water in a saucepan and warm gently on the hob.

I was looking to get a reasonably thin batter and 600ml did the trick on this occasion. Of course, add less or more milk and water as the situation dictates. Once the batter is mixed, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm room for about an hour, allowing the yeast to make the batter nice and bubbly.', 'When itâs ready, give the batter a gentle stir, smear a little butter or oil on a hot, non-stick skillet and add enough of the batter to thinly coat the bottom. Cook on one side until golden (about 3 minutes) and gently flip over and cook the other side for another couple of minutes.', 'Note: As oatcakes contain less flour, and wholemeal flour at that, they contain less gluten and will be more prone to tear.

Best Ever Banana Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting,"This is one of (if not) the BEST banana cake I have ever tasted! I thought the oven temp of 275Â° sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. I do not know if the little ""freezer trick"" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it, and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. Would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o)  Depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it.  I was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!! So glad I came across this one!! (on another website).

If, instead, you cover your egg pan with a pot lid, you can add the omelette filling from the outset and it cooks WITH the eggs, so your omelette's already done at the point where you'd normally add the filling.

Kittencal's Moist Cheddar-Garlic Oven Fried Chicken Breast,"This is for serious garlic lovers. The chicken bakes out so moist and tender! Grated cheese may be sprinkled on top of the breast the last 5 minutes of cooking if desired but that is optional. Double all ingredients for more than four breasts and adjust the amount of garlic to suit taste. For the coating amount you might be able to get away with 5 or maybe 6 very small chicken breasts, but I would suggest to increase the amount slightly --- to take this dish to yet another level, about 10 minutes before the cooking time is finished, drizzle the top of the chicken with a little pasta sauce, then sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top. Return to oven for about 10 minutes until the chicken is completely cooked and sauce is hot and cheese has melted. For a lemon-garlic flavor add in 3 tablespoons lemon juice to the melted butter/garlic mixture ---  *NOTE* for a healthier alternative Smart Balance Butter Blend may be used in place of the melted butter --- you will love this chicken!
